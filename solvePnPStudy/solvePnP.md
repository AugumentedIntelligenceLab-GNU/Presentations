# solvePnP

> "solvePnP" is a computer vision algorithm that stands for "solve Perspective-n-Point." It is used to estimate the 3D pose (position and orientation) of an object in a camera image, given the 2D location of certain points on that object.
> 
> The algorithm takes in as input the 2D coordinates of several known points in the image and their corresponding 3D coordinates in the object's coordinate system. The algorithm then uses this information to estimate the camera's extrinsic parameters (position and orientation) and intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, etc.) relative to the object.
> 
> The solvePnP algorithm is widely used in computer vision applications such as robotics, augmented reality, and object tracking. It is often used in conjunction with other computer vision techniques, such as feature detection and matching, to achieve more accurate and robust object tracking and pose estimation.
